# Arduino_Sketches
### Introduction
This repository contains several Arduino sketches I have written while learning Arduino. 
Most of them include code on small projects like how to use a button as a toggle switch. 


**NOTE** these projects will all get their own repo, so this repository
does not have the latest version of all projects yet. That said I will update
this bulk repo on request or if time permits.
