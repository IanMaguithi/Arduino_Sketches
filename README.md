# Arduino_Sketches
### Introduction
This repository contains several Arduino sketches I have written while learning Arduino with the help of most excellent video tutorials from [Paul McWhorter](https://www.toptechboy.com/arduino-lessons/) . 
Most of them include small projects like how to use a button as a toggle switch to using stepper and DC motors. 


**NOTE** these projects will all get their own repo, so this repository
does not have the latest version of all projects yet. That said I will update
this bulk repo on request or if time permits.
